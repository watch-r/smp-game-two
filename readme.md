# 🔪 Killer Blink Game – Web Version (MVP)

A **real-life party game** meets the web!  
This project is a **minimal web-based companion** for the popular **"Killer Blink"** game, where players interact in-person and the website tracks roles, phases, and timers.

## 🎮 Game Concept

- **Roles**: Each player is randomly assigned a role:  
  - 🕶️ **Killer**: Kills players by blinking at them  
  - 🧍 **Civilian**: Survive and observe  
  - 👮 **Police**: Try to catch the killer  
- **Phases**:
  - 🌙 **Night**: Killer silently eliminates by blinking  
  - 🕵️ **Day**: Discussion & voting to identify the killer

The web version tracks game **phases, roles, and timers**, while real actions (like blinking) are performed **face-to-face**.
